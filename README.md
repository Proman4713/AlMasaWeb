# Redesign of Al Masa EG's website
This website is made using React Router v7 + Cloudflare Workers to ensure absolutely 0$ COST for hosting (with SSR).

It is my own redesign of a local Egyptian company, Al Masa EG's, website. Made as a showcase of skills in web development and web design.
The original website showed multiple performance, technological and accessibility issues. And my website was a quick-and-dirty redesign of the original website aimed at fixing these issues and showing practical differences *then* cleaning up the code.

This project specifically trained my skills in Web Design, with React Router v7 + Cloudflare Workers..

Their **original website** can be found [here](https://almasa-egypt.com/).
My **new website** can be found [here](https://almasa-crr-worker.mailworker.workers.dev/).
